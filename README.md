# DSC-011-Sp25-tAPP22

This repository provides data and a notebook template to complete the tAPP22 assignment on 
Publication-Quality Graphs with `ggplot2`, Tidy Data, and Pivots in R/tidyverse as well as
notebook authoring in Quarto.

This lesson is part of the Data Science and Computing (DSC) course 011 on Computing and 
Statistical Programming, Spring of 2025 offering by Professor David Ardell.

This repo is meant to be used while completing the tAPP22 lesson in the DSC 011 Swirl course in a 
public repo under my github dhard with course name DSC_011_Sp25.
